## What is Jara?
Jara is a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot with a modular approach. Rather than having a fixed set of commands and features, you can install or create modules to suit your every need. No more will you need to manage multiple bots in a single server!

Out of the box Jara provides a vast array of customisation options individual to each server, including permissions, audio settings, command settings, and more. Each module can also provide its own configuration options.
It's also possible to create your own basic commands right in the bot, without knowing any code!

### What are modules?
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/Lc4p8Am.png)
Modules are drag-and-drop .jar files that add new functionality to the bot. These could be commands, games, audio,  admin, etc, and can each be enabled/disabled on a per-server basis.

As Jara is open-source, anyone is free to develop their own modules, for any functionality they may need.  
A repository of my modules is available [here](https://github.com/Zazsona/Jara-Module-Sources).
